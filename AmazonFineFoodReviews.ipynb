      "i have seen 9 dogs chew these rawhides.  they all love them, and most of them are clean.  however, one of these dogs will rip any toy up.  she is the type of dog that might pull them apart and leave pieces on the floor.  these dogs never left a piece behind.  every now and then i will see another dog with it in pieces but it isn't very common and they always clean it up.  they don't leave any of it behind.<br /><br />the only time i ever saw one as dangerous for the dog is my english mastiff had it all slobbery and it unrolled.  he wasn't smart enough to realize that he couldn't have half of it down his throat and still be chewing on the other half.  i just pulled it out and threw it away.  i still give them to him and we only had a problem that one time.  it has saved us from many dog problems.  they are happy to chew on these and know they are for them.  we tried to have them laying around for them all the time so when they feel the urge to chew, they go for their own toy.  i think they are great for puppies to save your own stuff.  adults love them also.<br /><br />the product itself is wonderful.  i was buying them for almost $11 at sams (15 pack) and i can't bring myself to buy them on amazon because of the price as it is double.  i buy a lot of things through amazon, but this isn't a product i intend to buy from amazon.  if you are really interested in these rawhide rolls, put it in a search engine and see what you can find.  i have seen a lot of them for $14.99.  i only searched for them because i couldn't find them at sams last time i was there but if i have to go somewhere else to get them, it won't be amazon.<br /><br />either way, the product is great.  i first bought them for the dogs that like to chew on things, it turned out that the ones who don't usually chew on things like them too.<br /><br />my dad has border collies for working cattle, one of them had pretty bad plaque build up and the vet thought he needed to be put to sleep to clean it off.  something happened and he didn't get in when he was supposed to. i gave some of these rawhide rolls to him, he didn't need anything more.  after awhile of chewing on them, he was cleaned up.<br /><br />if amazon gets more reasonable, i would definitely be willing to buy them through amazon.  i will keep using this product for my dogs, and after i gave them to my parents dogs, they decided they were a good to have product too.\n",
